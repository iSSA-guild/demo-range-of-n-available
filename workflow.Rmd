## Preparing an iSSA

### The data

There are several things that need to be done prior to actually doing an iSSA

Overarchingly:
1. Clean the GPS data
2. Prepare the layers and other covariate data

#### Clean the GPS data

Things that you need to check and clean if they are not met:
1. Make sure all observations (GPS points) are complete
 - if not, remove incomplete observations
2. Check if there are duplicated GPS points (two taken at the same time)
 - remove duplicate observations

#### Prepare covariate input data

It is critical that all of the layers you plan to use and GPS points are in the same coordinate reference system. This can take a long time to reproject layers, crop them, and anything else you need to do for everything to be in the same "world," but it is critical to do for the later steps of extracting covariates by step.

### Making tracks

Once the data is clean, we make the points into a track. If you have more than one individual in the dataset, do it by individual.

```{r amt}
require(amt)
tracks <- dat %>% make_track(long, lat, datetime, crs = sp::CRS("+init=epsg:4326"), id = id)
```

#### Check the sampling rate

Now we should check how the sampling rate looks due to the messiness of GPS relocations.

```{r sampling rate}
trk_sk %>% mutate(sr = lapply(data, summarize_sampling_rate)) %>%
  dplyr::select(id, sr) %>% unnest(cols = c(sr))
```

Data are messy. For iSSA, we need the GPS fixes to happen at regular intervals, so we likely need to resample the data.

```{r resample}
require(amt) # This needs to be checked and updated, I don't know what I'm doing
resample_tracks <- function(tracks, rate, tolerance) {
  t <- track_resample(tracks, rate = rate, tolerance = tolerance) %>%
    filter_min_n_burst()
}
```


### Steps

Now we have tracks, but a step selection analysis requires steps!

```{r steps}
require(amt) # This needs to be checked and updated, I don't know what I'm doing
resample_tracks <- function(tracks, rate, tolerance) {
  t <- track_resample(tracks, rate = rate, tolerance = tolerance) %>%
    filter_min_n_burst()
  
  # Cancel if there are not at least three rows after resample
  tar_cancel(nrow(t) < 3)
  
  t %>% steps_by_burst(., lonlat = TRUE)  
}
```

#### Check the distribution of steps and turn angles

Now to make sure there aren't any weirdos in the steps.  Usually there are a lot of little steps and few big steps, but this is a good check to make sure any erroneous obsevations are removed. For instance, this would show if there are any steps that are not biologically possible. It also shows the distribution so you know if you should use a Gamma or exponential distribution for generating random steps. Most are Gamma, and that is the default in `amt`.

```{r sl/ta distributions}
#graph
```


### Prepare the data to go into the iSSA

So, at this point, we have our observed steps and know what their distributions look like. Now we can use this information to properly inform our random steps with the correct distribution. As we create the random steps, we will also extract the covariates of interest at each step. 

#### Motivation vs Selection

One of the critical decisions to make in your analysis is if you want to know if a variable is motivating why/how an animal moves vs. if the animal is selecting for that variable; this decision influences if you use the information from the start of the step (motivation) vs. the end of the step (selection) in your analysis. This decision is of course determined by your question and hypotheses 

TODO: Fill in more, get CMP input

#### Example extraction

For example, here we are creating random steps and extracting information about what landcover class an individual selects for (at the end of each step) and how time of day (day or night at the start of the step) influences their movement. This will create a dataset that includes step length, turn angle, whether it's day or night at the star of the step, and what land class an animal is on at the end of their step.

If you have multiple hypotheses that would benefit from know information from both the beginning and the end of the step, you can input`"both"` insted of `"start"` or `"end"`.

```{r sl/ta distributions}
make_random_steps <- function(DT, lc) {
  tar_cancel(nrow(DT) == 0)
  random_steps(DT, n = 10) %>%
    extract_covariates(lc, where = "end") %>%
    time_of_day(where = 'start')
}
```


## Running and iSSA

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
